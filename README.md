MAX6954 LED Driver Library
==========================

This library was written to control one or two MAX6954 chips with an Arduino.

Installation
------------

Download or clone this repository into your Arduino libraries folder. On Mac OS
or Linux you can run this in the terminal to get up and running.

    cd ~/Documents/Arduino/
    mkdir libraries
    git clone https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/MAX6954.git max6954

Once installed you should be able to see a max6954 menu option under File >
Examples > max6954 within the Arduino IDE.

Wiring
------

I connected the MAX6954s to the arduino using the SPI pins (see the
[connections](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI) section from the arduino
reference page on SPI). For the Uno or Duemilanove the pins are:

* Master out slave in (MOSI) or DOUT - Pin 11
* Master in slave out (MISO) or DIN - Pin 12
* Clock (SCK) or CLK - Pin 13
* Chip 1 Select (SS) or CS - Pin 9
* Chip 2 Select (SS) or CS - Pin 8

The [MAX6954 Data Sheet](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX6954.pdf)
says that the chips can be chained (see Figure 2. MAX6954 Daisy-Chain
Connection) but I was getting data corruption with my setup. The corruption completely went away when I controlled each chip individually.

To connect the MAX6954 to your 16 segment digits refer to Table 2. Connection Scheme for Eight 16-Segment Digits and Figure 1. Segment Labeling for 7-Segment Display, 14-Segment Display, and 16-Segment Display in the [data sheet](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX6954.pdf). I used [these digits](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/232).

### String Output Test

This example shows how to output string using the built in font provided
on the MAX6954 itself. It also demos lowercase strings which are
generated by turning individual segments on and off.

[string_output.ino](https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/MAX6954/blob/master/examples/string_output/string_output.ino) provided in the library.

### Larson Scanner Test

This example demonstrates the use of individual digit brightness
control.

[larson.ino](https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/MAX6954/blob/master/examples/larson/larson.ino) provided in the library.
